If you want to use the example code in your own projects, this is the calling convention for the contained functions:

Calling functions:
When you call a subroutine, all registers in the range r1->r12 and a0->a3 may be changed by the subroutine
if you need a value for later, push it on the stack.
r13->r15 and a4->a13 are unchanged

all arguments to the subroutine passed in r1. if there is more than one parameter, successively higher registers are used.
the result from the subroutine is returned in r1. if there is more than one returned value, successively higher registers are used to store the additional values.
