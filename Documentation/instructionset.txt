Technical specifications:
clock rate: 	384kHz
memory:		64k words
cache:		256 words instruction, 256 words data
		2-way associative, replacement policy: LRU
word length:	32-bit
registers:	32
fpu:		two 4-word stacks

some of these values can be accessed in software through these labels by including libLabel.txt:

label:				verbose:
CPU_CLOCKRATE			clock rate for the cpu
CPU_RAM				total amount of memory addresses in ram
CPU_MAXADDRESS			maximum addressable location in memory


Registers:

r0->r12 register 0 to 12
note:
	r0	can also be accessed as "zero" and always contains the value 0

a0->a12 	register 16 to 28. Can be used exactly as the other registers, they just use a different naming scheme.

Other registers:
	ra (Return Address)	is set to pc when call/callr is used and pc-1 when loop is used.
	sp (Stack Pointer)	is used by the push/pop instructions. Should be set to point at a stack.
	fp (Frame Pointer)
	ex (EXtra)		contains overflow/underflow from addition, subtraction, multiplication and bitshifting. It also contains the remainder after division.
	es (Exception Status)	when an interrupt is triggered this register is set to the interrupt number
	ea (Exception Address)	when an interrupt is triggered this register is set to pc
	pc (Program Counter)	points to the next instruction


Instructions:

rA = first register specified
rB = second register specified
rC = third register specified
C  = constant, 16-bit unsigned integer
lC = long constant, 21-bit unsigned integer
pc = program counter, 16-bit unsigned integer

Most instructions are written on the form
"instruction rA rB rC/C/lC"
sometimes one or several are left out, but they are always listed in that order.
the constant can be declared as a hexadecimal number (prefixed with 0x), a binary number(prefixed with 0b) or a base-10 number (no prefix)

floating point instructions:
The operands in the floating point operations are ordered like this: (top-1) * top, (top-1) - top, (top-1) / top, (top-1) + top.
note that both floating point stacks can perform operations simultaneously, and that the cpu does not have to wait for them to finish their operations, unless using the fpush/fpop instructions

Name:		Meaning:

fpush		push rA to floating point stack
fpush1		push floating point 1 to floating point stack
fpushn1		push floating point -1 to floating point stack

fdiv		pop two numbers from stack, perform division, push result to stack
fsel0		select floating point stack 0
fsel1		select floating point stack 1
fmerge		adds the top number of stack 0 to top number of stack 1, result pushed to stack 0
ftof		converts the integer at the top of the stack to a floating point number, and pushes on the stack
ftoi		converts the floating point number at the top of the stack to integer, and pushes on the stack
fflush		removes all entries from the selected floating point stack and aborts all operations
fss		retreives some information on the floating point unit: the high half word contains the currently selected stack, the low half word contains the stack pointer

Extended instruction set:
please be aware that the assembler is not good at using these instructions yet, so don't put a constant higher than 255
in them or you will use the wrong instruction

Name:		Meaning:			Result:

movb/movbr	MOVe Byte			replace byte C/rC of rA with byte C/rC of rB
movhw/movhwr	MOVe Half-Word			replace half-word C/rC of rA with half-word C/rC of rB
movbl/movblr	MOV Byte Low			replace byte C/rC of rA with byte 0 of rB
movhwl/movhwlr	MOVe Half-Word Low		replace half-word C/rC of rA with half-word 0 of rB


Interrupts:

in order to enable interrupts the memory at address 45, or "GLOBAL_IENABLE" if libLabel.txt is included, needs to be modified.
the different bits in the memory adress have the following effect:
bit	0:	enables interrupts to be queued
	1:	enables interrupt queue handling
	2+:	does nothing yet

when an interrupt occurs pc is immidiately set to the adress stored at address 44, or "GLOBAL_IADRESS", the interrupt id is copied to register es and pc is copied to register ea.
when the cpu jumps, bit 1 is immediately set to 0.
one interrupt can be handled per instruction executed.
256 interrupts can be queued at a time

built in interrupts:
interrupt id		cause
256			timer has flipped to 0
258			illegal instruction/division by 0


Assembler:

The ".meta", ".data" and ".text" sections:

All intructions for the assembler needs to follow one of these tags.
If something other than a comment is not surrounded by a tag, the compiler will give the error: "text outside of specified field"
You can have multiple instrances of the same section in each file.
When the code is compiled the fields are merged together in the order they appear, so the last .data section specified will be at the bottom of the .data section.
when using the #include keyword all fields are merged so that the #included fields are placed last

The ".meta" tag signifies that you are trying to tell the assembler how to compile your code. Within this field you can change these options:
PIC		default: off	will make a bunch of errors if you try to perform an operation that cannot be done if you don't know where the program is loaded
MAINJMP		default: on	will add the line "br main" in the beginning of the file. This will make the code start execution at the "main"-label declared #global
AUTOSTACK	default: on	will add the line "movi	sp, DATA_END" at the beginning of the file. This will automatically set the stack pointer to a good-ish position.
ALWERR		default: off	will make sure that if there is a warning somewhere, the warning will stop compilation. This probably does nothing at the moment
AUTLDR		default: on	does nothing at the moment.
the syntax is this:
.meta
PIC=FALSE
MAINJMP=TRUE

if an option is declared both true and false, the assembler will refuse to assemble the program.

the .text section contains all instructions. The syntax is described elsewhere
example:
.text
#global main
main:
	movi	r1, 1
	movi	r2, 2
	add	r1, r1, r2
	wr	r1, r0, GLOBAL_NUMPAD_OUT
	halt

the .data section contains all data the program needs
labels can still be used here
data can be declared as hexadecimal, binary, floating point or normal base 10 integers.
example:
.data
some_data:
0b10000	;binary number
0x10	;hexadecimal number
16	;base 10
16.0	;floating point

labels:

any line where the first word ends in ':' is a location, which can be used in, for example, the jmp instruction.
the jmp, jmpr, eret and callr instructions use the absolute rather than the relative value when modifying pc.
All other branching instructions instructions use pc-relative addressing
example:
	loop:
	nop
	jmp loop
will execute the nop and jmp instructions forever.

keywords:

#global	<label>
this keyword will make sure that the label will be accessable from all files that #include that file.
example:
	#global example
	example:
	...

#include <file>
will merge the file you specify with the current one. A file can only be #included once
example:
	#include example.txt

#allocate <number>
Will put number of zero - initialised integers where the #allocate statement was placed. It can only be placed in the .data section.

#string "<string>"
will put the specified string into memory in ascii format using 4 chars per word. It will also add null-termination.
the string will be read from the first " to the last ", anything else will be regarded as a comment
the following escape sequences are supported:
	\n	line feed
	\a	bell
	\t	horizontal tab
	\0	null
	\\	backslash
	\"	"
	\f	form feed
	\r	carrige return
the string must be spacified across a single line
this keyword can only be placed in the .data section

#stringw "<string>"
the same as #string, except it uses one character per word instead of four characters per word.
this makes strings easier to use, at the expense of them using more memory.
note that the example code expects the "#string"-strings

#macro <macroname> <parameters> {
<stuff>
}
will create a macroinstruction called macroname, using the declared ammount of parameters.
this macro can then be used as a normal instruction.
example:
#macro add3 rA rB rC {
	add	rA, rA, rB
	add	rA, rA, rC
}

the parameters specified in the macro definition are changed using a primitive
find-and-replace on the old parameters using the new, so don't ever do this:
#macro foo rA rAA {
or this:
#macro foo r1 r2 r3 {
if you do, there is the possibility that the compiler can't read the lines the macro produces, which can cause confusing error messages.
you can not use macros within macros yet.

#define <defineName> <number>
will substitute <defineName> with <number> when used as a parameter
example:
#define foo 16
movi	r1, foo
.data
	foo

#literal <constant> will place the constant evaluated as a word in the program exactly where it is placed.
It is intended for putting arbitrary data into the .text section.
can only be used in the .text section.


Computer control panel:

To run a program on the cpu, first write the program in a plain text file. The file can be run by using the command
"insert asm <filename>" in the console.
all programs you want to load should be stored in <gamedir>/gamedata/progCom/plugins/PluginData/progCom

console commands:
insert [opt: asm] <filename>		Inserts the tape <filename> into the drive. using the optional asm command will signify that you are not loading a tape but assembly code. if "empty" is used as the filename, an empty tape is inserted.
print <offset>				prints the first 100 memory locations after the offset in the dev console (alt-f2)
clear					clears the console.
debug					toggle the emulators debug mode. This makes it run at cycle per frame and print everything it's doing to the dev console (Alt-f2).
step					if in debug mode, this will run the next instruction
asm <filename>	[opt: <location>]	will create a tape file (extension .pct) and save it into the plugindata folder. If the location is specified the program will be expected to be loaded there. Default (unspecified) is 256
save <filename>				will save the currently inserted tape into the pluginData folder
eject <filename>			will save the currently inserted tape into the plugindata folder, unless "null" is used as the filename. Afterwards it inserts an empty tape into the drive.

explaination of the buttons at the top of the panel:

ON/OFF		turn the computer on and off
CTL		toggles whether the computer can control pitch/yaw/roll etc. on and off. It also controls staging and translation until I implement separate buttons for that.
TTL		toggles whether the computer may control the throttle.
RST		resets the computer
GUI		minimizes/maximises the computer ui panel
MON		displays/hides the monitor
KBD		displays/hides the keyboard
