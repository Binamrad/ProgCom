Memory:

the first 128 memory locations (0->127) are reserved for memory mapped control and navigation values.
Most of the vectors here are in a fixed point format. The ordering of the parameters of the vectors are adress = X, adress+1 = Y, adress+2 = Z.
the accuracy of the fixed point vectors are determined by the value at GLOBAL_VERTORACCURACY. (the behind-the-scenes conversion from the floats that the game uses to the fixed point vectors is this: (int)(vector.whatever*global_vectorAccuracy)) All speed readings use *GLOBAL_SPEEDACCURACY rather than vectoracuracy.
these values can be accessed at the following defined adresses:

label				value	explaination

Registers:

r0->r15 register 0 to 15
note:
	r0	can also be accessed as zero, is always locked to 0
	r15	is set to pc when call/callr is used and pc-1 when loop is used. can also be accessed as ra (Return Adress).
	r14	is used by the push/pop instructions. Should be set to point at a stack. can also be accessed as sp (Stack Pointer).
	r13	can also be accessed as fp (Frame Pointer).
	Thus, you might want to be careful when overriding r13->r15

a0->a15 	auxilliary registers, register 16 to 31. Can be used exactly as the other registers, they just use a different naming scheme.
note:
	a14	can also be accessed as es, exeption status. If interrupts are enabled, this register can change unpredictably.
	a15	can also be accessed as ea, exception adress. If interrupts are enabled, this register can change unpredictably.

EX 		"extra" register
note:
	EX 	cannot be accessed the same way as r0->r15 and a0->a15.
	EX 	contains overflow/underflow from addition, subtraction, multiplication and bitshifting. It also contains the remainder after division.

floating point instructions:
The operands in the floating point operations are ordered like this: (top-1) * top, (top-1) - top, (top-1) / top, (top-1) + top.
note that both floating point stacks can perform operations simultaneously, and that the cpu does not have to wait for them to finish their operations, unless using the fpush/fpop instructions

Name:		Meaning:

fpush		push rA to stack
fpush1		push floating point 1 to stack
fpushn1		push floating point -1 to stack
fpushpi		push floating point pi to stack
fpop		rA = top of floating point stack
fadd		pop two numbers from stack, perform addition, push result to stack
fsub		pop two numbers from stack, perform subtraction, push result to stack
fmul		pop two numbers from stack, perform multiplication, push result to stack
fdiv		pop two numbers from stack, perform division, push result to stack
fsel0		select floating stack 0
fsel1		select floating stack 1
fmerge		adds the top number of stack 0 to top number of stack 1, result pushed to stack 0
ftof		converts the integer at the top of the stack to a floating point number, and pushes on the stack
ftoi		converts the floating point number at the top of the stack to integer, and pushes on the stack
fflush		removes all entries from the selected floating point stack and aborts all operations

Extended instruction set:
please be aware that the assembler is not good at using these instructions yet, so don't put a constant higher than 255
in them or you will use the wrong instruction

movb		MOVe Byte			replace byte C of rA with byte C of rB
movhw		MOVe Half-Word			replace half-word C of rA with half-word C of rB
movbl		MOV Byte Low			replace byte C of rA with byte 0 of rB
movhwl		MOVe Half-Word Low		replace half-word C of rA with half-word 0 of rB


Interrupts:

in order to enable interrupts the memory at adress "GLOBAL_IENABLE" needs to be modified.
the different bits in the memory adress have the following effect:
bit	0:	enables interrupts
	1:	enables interrupts from the timer
	2:	enables interrupts when the flight status variables (yaw etc) are updated.
	3:	enables interrupts when GLOBAL_NUMPAD_NEWIN != 0
	4:	enables interrupts from the serial buses
	5+:	does nothing yet

when an interrupt occurs pc is immidiately set to the adress stored at "GLOBAL_IADRESS".
when the cpu jumps, interrupts are immidiately disabled.
one interrupt can be handled per instruction executed.

when hardware exceptions occur, values of 256 or higher are copied into the es register. this is what the values mean:
256:	timer has flipped to 0
257:	flight status variables updated (pitch, yaw etc.)
258:	unimplemented/illegal instruction at ea-1 (unless the interrupt has been delayed, in which case the instruction could be anywhere)
259:	input from numpad available (note: this exception will keep appearing while GLOBAL_NUMPAD_NEWIN != 0)
260-267:serial bus 0-7, IBF or OBE
268+:	not implemented yet.


Assembler:

The ".meta", ".data" and ".text" sections:

All intructions for the assembler needs to follow one of these tags.
If something other than a comment is not surrounded by a tag, the compiler will give the error: "text outside of specified field"
You can have multiple instrances of the same section in each file.
When the code is compiled the fields are merged together in the order they appear, so the last .data section specified will be at the bottom of the .data section.
when using the #include keyword all fields are merged so that the #included fields are placed last

The ".meta" tag signifies that you are trying to tell the assembler how to compile your code. Within this field you can change these options:
PIC		default: off	will make a bunch of errors if you try to perform an operation that cannot be done if you don't know where the program is loaded
MAINJMP		default: on	will add the line "br main" in the beginning of the file. This will make the code start execution at the "main"-label declared #global
AUTOSTACK	default: on	will add the line "movi	sp, DATA_END" at the beginning of the file. This will automatically set the stack pointer to a good-ish position.
ALWERR		default: off	will make sure that if there is a warning somewhere, the warning will stop compilation. This probably does nothing at the moment
AUTLDR		default: off	gives an error message when enabled, doesn't do anything yet.
the syntax is this:
.meta
PIC=FALSE
MAINJMP=TRUE

if an option is declared both true and false, the assembler will refuse to assemble the program.

the .text section contains all instructions. The syntax is described elsewhere
example:
.text
#global main
main:
	movi	r1, 1
	movi	r2, 2
	add	r1, r1, r2
	wr	r1, r0, GLOBAL_NUMPAD_OUT
	halt

the .data section contains all data the program needs
labels can still be used here
data can be declared as hexadecimal, floating point or normal base 10 integers.
example:
.data
some_data:
0x10
16
16.0

labels:

any line where the first word ends in ':' is a location, which can be used in, for example, the jmp instruction.
the jmp, jmpr, eret and callr instructions use the absolute rather than the relative value when modifying pc.
All other branching instructions instructions use pc-relative addressing
example:
	loop:
	nop
	jmp loop
will execute the nop and jmp instructions forever.

keywords:

#global	<label>
this keyword will make sure that the label will be accessable from all files that #include that file.
example:
	#global example
	example:
	...

#include <file>
will merge the file you specify with the current one. A file can only be #included once
example:
	#include example.txt

#allocate <number>
Will put number of zero - initialised integers where the #allocate statement was placed. It can only be placed in the .data section.

#string "<string>"
will put the specified string into memory in ascii format using 4 chars per word. It will also add null-termination.
the string will be read from the first " to the last ", anything else will be regarded as a comment
the following escape sequences are supported:
	\n	line feed
	\a	bell
	\t	horizontal tab
	\0	null
	\\	backslash
	\"	"
	\f	form feed
	\r	carrige return
the string must be spacified across a single line
this keyword can only be placed in the .data section

#stringw "<string>"
the same as #string, except it uses one character per word instead of four characters per word.
this makes strings easier to use, at the expense of them using more memory.
note that the example code expects the "#string"-strings

#macro <macroname> <parameters> {
<stuff>
}
will create a macroinstruction called macroname, using the declared ammount of parameters.
this macro can then be used as a normal instruction.
example:
#macro add3 rA rB rC {
	add	rA, rA, rB
	add	rA, rA, rC
}

the parameters specified in the macro definition are changed using a primitive
find-and-replace on the old parameters using the new, so don't ever do this:
#macro foo rA rAA {
or this:
#macro foo r1 r2 r3 {
if you do, there is the possibility that the compiler can't read the lines the macro produces, which can cause confusing error messages.
you can not use macros within macros yet.

#define <defineName> <number>
will substitute <defineName> with <number> when used as a parameter
example:
#define foo 16
movi	r1, foo
.data
	foo


Computer control panel:

To run a program on the cpu, first write the program in a plain text file. The file can be run by using the command
"load run <filename>" in the console.
all programs you want to load should be stored in PluginData/programmableComputer

console commands:
load [opt: run] <filename>		load the file into memory. using the optional run command will start the file as a program. omitting the second argument will simply leave the data in memory.
print					prints the first 100 memory locations in the dev console (alt-f2)
clear					clears the console.
run <number>				set pc to <number> and start the computer.
debug					toggle the emulators debug mode. This makes it run at 120Hz and print everything it's doing to the dev console (Alt-f2).

explaination of the buttons at the top of the panel:

ON/OFF		turn the computer on and off
CTL		toggles whether the computer can control pitch/yaw/roll etc. on and off. It also controls staging and translation until I implement separate buttons for that.
TTL		toggles whether the computer may control the throttle.
RST		resets the computer
GUI		minimizes/maximises the computer ui panel


Misc:

regarding actiongroups:
	the action group memory slot resets to zero at roughly the same frequency as the flight variables update, ie once per frame.
	the numbers you write to the slot have the following effects:
		0: 	nothing
		1->10: 	toggle custom action group 1->10
		11:	toggle Abort group
		12:	Activate next stage
		13+:	Nothing, yet
	the group is toggled when the memory slot is reset.
