This file gives a brief description of the progcom monitor.
the monitor has two modes, a tileset-graphics text mode (Mode A) and
a pixel graphics monochrome mode (Mode B).
Mode A is the default mode


Mode A:

colors:		16
resolution:	32*32 8x8 tiles
data size:	512 words screen data + 512 words tileset

Data format:
each word in the data secion is interpreted as two characters
each character uses 8 bit ascii code and two four-bit fields for choosing color
for example, a 2 in color field A will set the character itself to color two, as defined in the color vector
a 2 in color field B will set the background of the character to color 2.

illustration of the data layout:
		      col. a
|XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX|BBBB|AAAA|CCCCCCCC|
second char	 col. b	   ascii code


Mode B:

colors:		2
resolution	256*256 pixels
data size:	2048 words screen data

Data format:
each bit represents a pixel, 0 makes the pixel use color 0, while 1 makes it use color 1.
the first word will set the first 32 pixels from the upper left corner, wile successive entries will set pixels right and downwards.


NOTES:
when using monochrome mode, be aware that the tileset is stored inside of the screen data
if you want to do text rendering after drawing, you need to either have your own tileset
and put the data back, or temporarily store the standard tileset.

detailed explaination:

GLOBAL_SCREEN:

this label points to the first address for storing screen data

GLOBAL_SCREEN_COLOR:

this label points to a vector containing 16 colors in XXXXRRRRGGGGBBBB format
the default colors stored at this location are these:
0:  0x00000000
1:  0x00ffffff
2:  0x0068372b
3:  0x0070a4b2
4:  0x006f3d86
5:  0x00588d43
6:  0x00352879

10: 0x009a6759
11: 0x00444444
12: 0x006c6c6c
13: 0x009ad284
14: 0x006c5eb5
15: 0x00959595

GLOBAL_SCREEN_FONT:

this label points to the tileset used when in mode A.
the tileset uses 512 words of data to store all tiles.
each tile takes two words in memory, so there is a total of 256 tiles.
each tile uses 8x8 pixels, each row being one byte.
the rows are stored so that the first row is stored as the first 8 bits in a word

for example, the code for this character:

00000000	
00000000 
00100100 
00000000 
00111100
00011000
00000000
00000000

is:
0x00240000
0x0000183c

GLOBAL_SCREEN_MODE

when set to 0, the monitor will be set to mode A, text mode
when set to 1, the monitor will be set to mode B, monochrome
