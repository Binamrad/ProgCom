There are 8 serial buses connected to progcom
they start at address 64 and each use 4 addresses. They are "stacked" back to back.



0: status
1: input buffer
2: output buffer
3: reserved

status register bits
0: interrupt enable
1: output buffer empty
2: input buffer full
3: sending
4: receiving
5: recipient ready

INTERRUPTS:
if interrupts are enabled an interrupt will be created if bit
1 and/or 2 are set to 1

SENDING:
When the recipient is ready to receive something, recipient ready is set to 1
in order to send anything over to whatever 
is connected to the thing, just write it to the output buffer
when sending is started, hte "receiving" flag of the recipient is set to 1. it is unset when the transmission is finished.
when sending is finished, OBE will be set to 1

RECEIVING
when the interface starts to receive something "receiving" is set to 1. it is unset when finished.
when there is something to fetch from the input buffer, IBF is set to 1. it will have to be set to 0 manually


IMPLEMENTING A SERIAL INTERFACE
if you want your mod to communicate with the progcom mod, create a part or partmodule for ksp,
extend the ASerialTransceiver class,
search the vessel for an IserialConnector part and then call the "connect" method
example:
foreach(Part p in vessel) {
	foreach(PartModule pm in p.Modules) {
		if(pm is ISerialConnector) {
			((ISerialConnector) pm).connect(this, 2);
		}
	}
}
there are currently 8 slots to connect to. to see if a slot is occupied, call the "bool slotOccupied(int)" method.


METHODS IN THE ASerialTransceiver ABSTRACT CLASS:
void send(UInt32)
Will send the specified integer to the emulator

void stopSend()
will immediately stop sending what is currently being sent.

bool canSend()
retruns true if it is currently possible to send something to the emulator.

bool hasReceived()
Returns true if progCOm has sent something to the device.

Int32 getLastReceived()
if input has been received, this method will return it.

abstract void serialUpdate()
Called once per cycle from the emulator. (As of this writing this is 384000 times per second. Don't put anything too processor-heavy here.)

virtual bool customReadyCondition()
A way to implement a device-specific way of telling the emulator that the device is ready to receive input. Various other factors are used behind-the-scene to determine this too.


If you'd like to implement everything from scratch, you can instead extend the ISerial interface.
METHODS IN THE ISerial INTERFACE
void rec_bit(bool)
this method is called once per cycle when receiving data. Each boolean value
represents a bit that has been transmitted.
in order to send a bit, call this method on the interface you have been connected to.

void rec_sending()
called when sending is initiated

void rec_send_done()
called when sending is done

bool ready()
returns true when the device is ready to receive data

connect(ISerial sBus)
provides the Serial bus interface you should send data to

disconnect()
called when you should no longer consider yourself connected to anything.

tick(int)
called once per executed instruction. The argument is the number of cycles
that has elapsed since the last
