Navigation:

Most of the vectors here are in a fixed point format. The ordering of the parameters of the vectors are adress = X, adress+1 = Y, adress+2 = Z.
the accuracy of the fixed point vectors are determined by the value at GLOBAL_VERTORACCURACY. (the behind-the-scenes conversion from the floats that the game uses to the fixed point vectors is this: (int)(vector.whatever*global_vectorAccuracy)) All speed readings use *GLOBAL_SPEEDACCURACY rather than vectoracuracy.


address		label				verbose
4		GLOBAL_SURFACE_EAST		the eastwards vector of the surface, in x,y,z of the scene coordinate system
7		GLOBAL_SURFACE_UP		the upwards vector of the surface, in x,y,z of the scene coordinate system
10		GLOBAL_SURFACE_NORTH		the northwards vector of the surface
13		GLOBAL_VESSEL_X			the x vector of the scene coordinate system according to the ship coord. system.
16		GLOBAL_VESSEL_Y			the y vector of the scene coordinate system according to the ship coord. system
16		GLOBAL_VESSEL_HEADING		same as above
19		GLOBAL_VESSEL_Z			the z vector of the scene coordinate system according to the ship coord. system
22		GLOBAL_ORBITSPEED		the orbital speed vector (speed*direction) of the ship th scene coord. system
25		GLOBAL_SURFACESPEED		the surface speed vector (speed*direction) of the ship in scene coord. system
28		GLOBAL_ANGULARVELOCITY		the angular velocity vector of the ship
31		GLOBAL_ALTITUDE			the altitude of the ship, in metres. (this is not affected by vector precision)
41		GLOBAL_VECTORACCURACY	  	the accuracy for the fixed-point vectors the computer uses to represent position and rotation. defaults to 1024.
42		GLOBAL_RADARALT			the altitude of the craft over the terrain, in meters. (this is not affected by vector precision)
43		GLOBAL_SPEEDACCURACY		accuracy for fixed-point vectors used for velocity. defaults to 16. if negative it is interpreted as (1/-GLOBAL_SPEEDACCURACY) when calculating the vectors. This is useful if you are traveling near, at or over the speed of light.

Numpad:

address		label				verbose
32		GLOBAL_NUMPAD_OUT		the locations for the numpad output numbers.
36		GLOBAL_NUMPAD_MSG		the final numpad output location. functionally the same but with another label.
37		GLOBAL_NUMPAD_IN		the numpad input location.
38		GLOBAL_NUMPAD_NEWIN		this adress is set to 1 when use user presses enter on the numpad. must be set to 0 by a program.
39		GLOBAL_NUMPAD_FORMAT		this adress is read to determine the format of the output. Each output area has 2 bits to determine it's format. 0 = integer, 1 = floating point. 2 & 3 are unused at the moment.
40		--				unused

48		GLOBAL_PILOT_THROTTLE		the pilot-entered value for the throttle. 0 is minimum, 1024 is maximum.
49		GLOBAL_PILOT_YAW		the pilot-entered value for the yaw. -1024 is minimum, 1024 is maxium.
50		GLOBAL_PILOT_PITCH		the pilot-entered value for the pitch. -1024 is minimum, 1024 is maxium.
51		GLOBAL_PILOT_ROLL		the pilot-entered value for the roll. -1024 is minimum, 1024 is maxium.

Timer:

The timer contains information on how many cycles have elapsed since a specific point in time.

address		label				verbose
59		GLOBAL_CLOCK			the computer clock. contains the complete ammount of cycles that the computer has spent turned on.
60		GLOBAL_TIMER			the cpu:s timer is accessible at this adress. it contains the number of cycles that has elapsed since the timer last reset. can be written to and read from as normal.
61		GLOBAL_TIMER_MAX		the value at which the timer starts over at zero. if set to 0, the timer never resets.

interrupts	cause
256		automatic timer reset


Action group and staging manager:

In order to toggle an actiongroup or activate the next stage, write a value to address 55
the numbers you write to the slot have the following effects:
	0: 	nothing
	1->10: 	toggle custom action group 1->10
	11:	toggle Abort group
	12:	Activate next stage
	13+:	unused
