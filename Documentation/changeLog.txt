v.0.7.2
Fixed an issue that caused the emulator to not use the entire cache memory.


v.0.7.1
The monitor should no longer be blurry at lower resolutions.


v.0.7
the nop instruction should no longer set EX to 0
the plugindata folder has been renamed from "ProgCom" to "progcom" to fix an issue affecting linux users
the emulator should now properly use custom action groups 2->10
the "float" instruction never actually existed, it has now been removed from the documentation
since fpush0 no longer exists it has been removed from the documentation
the cmp instruction has been documented
when you give a label or a constant instead of rA/rB, the resulting error message should now be easier to understand
the assembler can now store strings. This is a work-in-prograss feature.
added a monitor


v.0.6
The documentation now properly states that the computer has 64k words of ram.
The opcodes now make a little more sense
Increased the clock speed to 384KHz
removed the gepc and loop instructions
added the ax, sx, bx, rdx, andi, ori, xori instructions
overflow in addition, subtraction and multiplication is now stored in the EX register. When using division the remainder is stored.
the #define statement is now documented


v.0.5
changed the int instruction to use a register instead of the address field to give a larger range of possible values to send it.
most branching instructions have changed the way they operate, from using absolute adresses to using relative ones.
rewrote the assembler from scratch. The assembler now supports:
	* macros
	* adding labels and constants
	* writing constants and floating point data to program code
	* dividing the code into data and code sections
	* file-local labels
	* specifying labels to use relative or absolute adress
	* the assembler now automatically sets the stack pointer to a good value
the assembler will no longer crash the game if you #include a file #including the original file
the assembler now has slightly better syntax
updated the documentation to include these changes and become somewhat clearer
some error messages are now make it slightly more obvious what went wrong.
optimized the "keepVertSpeed" thingy in libFlightHelper
changed example code to use the new syntax


v.0.4
Added the text file "timings" which contains more detailed documentation on the instructions.
I had forgotten to document the instruction gepc, it has now been added to the documentation.
The control panel no longer shows up when using a ship without a computer thing near another ship
There is no longer any gui-related problems with having several computers on your ship.
Documented the memory adresses the "GLOBAL_" labels pointed to
Added the ability for the cpu to control the RCS translation
Improved the documentation in several areas.
removed some debug lines from libfh_holdVertSpeed. It should no longer use up three numpad output locations.
iSqrt in libMath was not working properly. It should be working properly now.
slightly changed how the hardware interrupts behave.
the assembler now is slightly more helpful when there has been a compilation error.
you can now access the players control values.
removed 30 cycles execution time from the fdiv instruction.
added ability to toggle ActionGroups


v. 0.3
the cpu-emulator now simulates cache memory
the cpu-emulator now handles interrupts
the hacky multithreading support has been removed, this made the following changes necessary:
	* removed the instructions gtid, getof, sleep
added a clock. works like the timer but can not be changed by writing to it.
the timer now resets when it's value is greater than that stored in GLOBAL_TIMER_MAX
added the possibility to raise an interrupt with the timer when it resets
added int instruction, which causes an interrupt and sets es register to the parameter
updated the model to the new asas module
you can now specify the level of precision the fixed-point vectors for world coordinates use by writing to GLOBAL_VECTORACCURACY. default is 1024, same as before.
added labels GLOBAL_VECTORACCURACY, GLOBAL_IENABLE, GLOBAL_CLOCK, GLOBAL_IADRESS, GLOBAL_TIMER_MAX
you can now use the console command "run <number>" to start the emulator and set pc to any arbitrary location
fixed the 'subi' instruction. It now does what you'd expect it to do. (used to do nothing)
increased clock speed to 96 KHz to compensate for increased memory access times.
removed suggested use of registers from the instruction set manual. I felt it made the 'registers' section a bit confusing. It is now in a separate file.
cleaned up example code


v. 0.2
inclreased clock speed to 48 KHz
memory location 40 now contains a timer, measuring the time in milliseconds since the program started.
the fadd, fsub, fdiv, fmul, fmerge floating point instructions now take 50% longer to run.
added a label for the timer: GLOBAL_TIMER
added a label for the output format: GLOBAL_NUMPAD_FORMAT
the flight variables now update whenever available, instead of when the instruction "sleep" is run.
updated the documentation to reflect these changes.
updated the example code with the new labels
